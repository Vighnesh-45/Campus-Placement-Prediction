# Campus-Placement-Prediction

# Overview
This project uses Python to make a smart tool that predicts if a student will get a job on campus. The predictive model, predominantly powered by logistic regression, demonstrates high accuracy. The project focuses on simplicity, and practicality in aiding decision-makers in the academic domain.

# Key Objectives
• Develop a predictive model for campus placements using Python and machine learning algorithms.

• Achieve high accuracy, with logistic regression identified as the most accurate algorithm among the employed methods.

# Dependencies
• Python 3.x Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn
